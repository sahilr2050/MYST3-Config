# sublime-phpfmt for Windows - call to arms

On and off I receive GH issues about Window users with problems running this
plugin. Personally, I always work with Unix systems, and I cannot help people
on a platform, that essentially, I don't have access to.

So I am going to fork sublime-phpfmt into a different ST package, specifically
targeted to Window users.

In order to this to work for everyone, I need that Windows Pythonists to step
up and take over this fork. Please, contact me through github issues pages if
you are interested in this task.

This fork will happen in 04/21.
